# wsltty.appx

Windows Store Appx package of wsltty, terminal for Windows Subsystem for Linux with mintty. mintty is the [Cygwin] Terminal emulator, also available for [MSYS] and [Msys2].

## How to install

Download the 3 files attached to the release in the
[Release area](https://github.com/mintty/wsltty.appx/releases):
the appx package `wsltty.appx`,
the installation certificate `certfile.cer`,
and the install script `install_appx.cmd` (also in the repository).

Run the `install_appx.cmd` batch script as administrator.

### What the installer does

The installer batch script enables Developer Mode with two registry settings
(for Appx sideloading).
Then it installs the certificate `certfile.cer` to
TrustedPeople certificate store in Local Machine.
This allows to install the Appx package with `Add-AppxPackage` cmdlet
from Powershell. With uninstall option, these steps will be reversed.

## How to build

Read the **[developers page]** to know how to build this Appx package.

## How it works

The Appx package will be installed in `C:\ProgramFiles\WindowsApps\mintty.wsltty-xyz` folder. When it is launched the Launcher copies `wslbridge-backend` to `C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Local\packages\mintty.wsltty-xyz\LocalCache` folder. The Launcher also configures correct paths for icon and mintty configuration file (.minttyrc or mintty.config). Then mintty and wslbridge are executed from same `WindowsApps` folder . But the backend executes from `LocalCache` folder because there are restrictions to execute backend from `WindowsApps`. The Launcher may be removed in future releases.
